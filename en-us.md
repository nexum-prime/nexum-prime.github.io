Not all situations are treatable, since in many cases what the patient is facing is a trial, a necessary experience in their path. In these cases, everything possible will be done to help them go through this process in the best possible way.

Under no circumstances should medical treatments be interrupted or neglected. All clinical follow-up must be maintained until formal guidance or release by the responsible physician.

All tools described are general in nature; therefore, it is recommended to get in touch to identify which one is most appropriate for your case, and an anamnesis may be conducted for this purpose.

Depending on the needs of the service, the patient may be asked to provide videos, video calls, or photographs.
