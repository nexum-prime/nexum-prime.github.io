Not all situations are treatable, as in many cases what the individual is experiencing constitutes a trial — a necessary experience in their personal journey. In such situations, every effort will be made to provide support and guidance throughout the process.

All tools described are of a general nature; therefore, it is recommended to get in touch to identify which approach best fits each case. For this purpose, an anamnesis may be conducted.

An anamnesis is mandatory for any service and is used to assess the case and define the most appropriate approach.

During the anamnesis, indications for additional procedures may be identified, and it is up to the individual to decide whether or not to proceed with them.

In some cases, it may be necessary to decline the service, in which case the individual will be properly informed of the reasons for that decision.

Depending on the nature of the service, the individual may be asked to provide videos, participate in video calls, or submit photographs.

## 🩺 Anamnesis

<p style="background:#7b4a9e;color:#fff;font-weight:700;padding:10px 12px;border-radius:6px;">
An anamnesis is required in all cases, lasts approximately 10 minutes, and can be performed remotely or in person, free of charge.

When an individual seeks a specific treatment, their needs are assessed in order to determine the most appropriate course of action.
